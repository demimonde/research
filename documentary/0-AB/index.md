## A/B Testing

A/B testing allows to introduce a change to the website, and understand what impact it is going to have, measured in terms of increased or decreased conversion rate or the rate of reaching a certain touchpoint in the user journey. To be able to tell with certainty that the impact was due to that change, a statistical significance measure is used, which requires quite a lot of data.
