## A/B Testing

A/B testing allows to introduce a change to the website, and what impact is going to have, measured in terms of increased or decreased conversion rate or reaching a certain touchpoint in the user journey. To be able to tell with some certainty that the impact was due to that change, a statistical significance measure is used, which means somewhat a lot of data would have to be recorded.
