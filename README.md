## A/B Testing

A/B testing allows to introduce a change to the website, and understand what impact it is going to have, measured in terms of increased or decreased conversion rate or the rate of reaching a certain touchpoint in the user journey. To be able to tell with certainty that the impact was due to that change, a statistical significance measure is used, which requires quite a lot of data.

## UGC

The UGC (user-generated content) systems are those that allow businesses to use people's content in their marketing campaigns. The content comes from social media websites such as Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, and can be discovered with hashtags and keywords. When a relevant image is found, the system would ask the creator for their consent to use the image. Once the consent is obtained, the image is recorded in the database, and can be used in advertising materials across different media, including offline such as digital displays and billboards, as well as online on the company's website, social media and in retargeting ads.

### Customer-Centric

The strategy of using UGC is such that to place the customer in the center of a campaign, instead of the brand. It gives people the sense of freedom since they can identify better with other individuals rather than a corporate entity. There are a number of particular market areas which benefit the most from using the UGC:

1. Travel: since pictures taken during travelling are generally the most inspiring and good-looking once because they convey an experience of new places and show the most interesting parts of cities, travel agencies can use the content at different parts of user journeys.
1. Hospitality: similar to travel, the hospitality industry can use the content to showcase the actual experience that people receive. This would make potential customers trust the images more since they are done by people just like themselves, and not by a professional photographer with wide-angle lens to make rooms look larger and then edited in an image manipulation program.
1. Sports: sporting events will usually generate a lot of user content.

### Curation and Moderation

Each picture coming in a stream can be approved before it is visible to the audience.

### Visual Recognition

Using the most modern techniques in Computer Vision, businesses can identify what objects each picture is showing, what colors it has and what is its mood, including exciting (e.g., jumping off with a parachute), calm (a lake in the morning) or work-related (an office space), and others. This can then be bucketed into certain marketing campaigns.

### Targeting

After the recognition on the image was done, and some tagging of the user performed (e.g., according to what articles they read on the website), they can be shown specific images. If a person read about running, they will be shown a picture of running shoes, for example.

### Events

One of the business directions is to use content projected on the screens during live-events.

### Blogs

https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/user-generated-content-legally-leverage-in-marketing/

    Good read and timely. Brands and businesses need to own their UGC and the days of implied consent (via #yes or iApprove responses) are quickly coming to an end as they don't provide the legal protections, model releases, etc necessary to remove any potential liability.

    Anheuser Busch was recently sued in federal court over incorrect UGC usage. The case wasn't brought by the content creator, the case was brought to federal court by the model drinking a bottle of Natural Light n the photo.

    I recently wrote a piece about this on our blog. It's time brands own their UGC. And the only way to do so legally is to pay for it and have model releases.
